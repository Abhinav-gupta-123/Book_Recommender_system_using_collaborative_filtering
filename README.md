🍽️ Restaurant Rating Prediction - ML Model


📌 Overview


This project is part of the Cognifyz Internship Program, where the task is to build a restaurant rating prediction model based on various parameters. The dataset was provided by Cognifyz, and the goal was to train a machine learning model that accurately predicts restaurant ratings.

🚀 Process Workflow


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Understanding the dataset

Generating insights and patterns

Visualizing key relationships



Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering


Handling missing values

Encoding categorical features

Feature selection and extraction

Model Development & Optimization

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets


Testing multiple classification models

Hyperparameter tuning (Improved accuracy from 63% to 85%)


Deployment with Streamlit


Building a simple and interactive frontend


Allowing users to input restaurant details and get predicted ratings


📊 Dataset


The dataset consists of restaurant-related attributes such as:

Table booking availability

Online delivery option

Average cost for two people

Cuisines offered

Price range

Number of votes received
